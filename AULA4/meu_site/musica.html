        <p>Não é sobre ter todas as pessoas do mundo pra si <br>
           É sobre saber que em algum lugar alguém zela por ti<br>
           É sobre cantar e poder escutar mais do que a própria voz<br>
           É sobre dançar na chuva de vida que cai sobre nós<br>
           É saber se sentir infinito num universo tão vasto e bonito<br>
           É saber sonhar<br>
           E então fazer valer a pena<br>
           Cada verso daquele poema sobre acreditar<br>
           Não é sobre chegar no topo do mundo, saber que venceu<br>
           É sobre escalar e sentir que o caminho te fortaleceu<br>
           É sobre ser abrigo e também ter morada em outros corações<br>
           E assim ter amigos contigo em todas as situações<br>
           A gente não pode ter tudo<br>
           Qual seria a graça do mundo se fosse assim?<br>
           Por isso, eu prefiro sorrisos<br>
           E os presentes que a vida trouxe pra perto de mim<br>
           Não é sobre tudo que o seu dinheiro é capaz de comprar<br>
           E sim sobre cada momento, sorriso a se compartilhar<br>
           Também não é sobre correr contra o tempo pra ter sempre mais<br>
           Porque quando menos se espera a vida já ficou pra trás<br>
           Segura teu filho no colo<br>
           Sorria e abrace seus pais enquanto estão aqui<br>
           Que a vida é trem-bala, parceiro<br>
           E a gente é só passageiro prestes a partir<br>
           Laiá, laiá, laiá, laiá, laiá<br>
           Laiá, laiá, laiá, laiá, laiá<br>
           Segura teu filho no colo<br>
           Sorria e abrace seus pais enquanto estão aqui<br>
           Que a vida é trem-bala, parceiro<br>
           E a gente é só passageiro prestes a partir</p1>

        <p> Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
            I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br>
            When the morning comes<br>
            When we see what we've become<br>
            In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind<br>
            Not the fire that we've begun<br>
            Every argument, every word we can't take back<br>
            'Cause with the all that has happened<br>
            I think that we both know the way that this story ends<br>
            Then only for a minute<br>
            I want to change my mind<br>
            'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br>
            I wanna raise your spirits<br>
            I want to see you smile but<br>
            Know that means I'll have to leave<br>
            Know that means I'll have to leave<br>
            Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
            I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br>
            When the evening falls<br>
            And I'm left there with my thoughts<br>
            And the image of you being with someone else<br>
            Well, that's eating me up inside<br>
            But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay<br>
            Now if we jump together at least we can swim<br>
            Far away from the wreck we made<br>
            Then only for a minute<br>
            I want to change my mind<br>
            'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br>
            I wanna raise your spirits<br>
            I want to see you smile but<br>
            Know that means I'll have to leave<br>
            Know that means I'll have to leave<br>
            Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
            I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br>
            So I'll go, I'll go<br>
            I will go, go, go<br>
            So I'll go, I'll go<br>
            I will go, go, go<br>
            Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
            I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br>
            Even though I might not like this<br>
            I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier<br>
            Then only for a minute (only for a minute)<br>
            I want to change my mind<br>
            'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br>
            I wanna raise your spirits<br>
            I want to see you smile but<br>

        <p>I was listenin' to the ocean<br>
            I saw a face in the sand<br>
            But when I picked it up<br>
            Then it vanished away from my hands, dah<br>
            I had a dream, I was seven<br>
            Climbin' my way in a tree<br>
            I saw a piece of Heaven<br>
            Waitin' in patience for me, dah<br>
            And I was runnin' far away<br>
            Would I run off the world someday?<br>
            Nobody knows, nobody knows<br>
            And I was dancing in the rain<br>
            I felt alive and I can't complain<br>
            But no, take me home<br>
            Take me home where I belong<br>
            I can't take it anymore<br>
            I was painting a picture<br>
            The picture was a painting of you<br>
            And for a moment I thought you were here<br>
            But then again, it wasn't true, dah<br>
            And all this time I have been lyin'<br>
            Oh, lyin' in secret to myself<br>
            I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf<br>
            La-di-da<br>
            And I was runnin' far away<br>
            Would I run off the world someday?<br>
            Nobody knows, nobody knows<br>
            And I was dancing in the rain<br>
            I felt alive and I can't complain<br>
            But no, take me home<br>
            Take me home where I belong<br>
            I got no other place to go<br>
            No, take me home<br>
            Take me home where I belong<br>
            I got no other place to go<br>
            No, take me home<br>
            Take me home where I belong<br>
            I can't take it anymore<br>
            But I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall<br>
            And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall<br>
            And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall<br>
            And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall<br>
            And I was runnin' far away<br>
            Would I run off the world someday?<br>
            But no, take me home<br>
            Take me home where I belong<br>
            I got no other place to go<br>
            No, take me home<br>
            Take me home where I belong<br>
            I got no other place to go<br>
            No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no<br>
            No, take me home, home where I belong, oh, oh, oh<br>
            No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no<br>

            <p>I'm a phoenix in the water<br>
                A fish that's learned to fly<br>
                And I've always been a daughter<br>
                But feathers are meant for the sky<br>
                So I'm wishing, wishing further<br>
                For the excitement to arrive<br>
                It's just I'd rather be causing the chaos<br>
                Than laying at the sharp end of this knife<br>
                With every small disaster<br>
                I'll let the waters still<br>
                Take me away to some place real<br>
                'Cause they say home is where your heart is set in stone<br>
                It's where you go when you're alone<br>
                It's where you go to rest your bones<br>
                It's not just where you lay your head<br>
                It's not just where you make your bed<br>
                As long as we're together, does it matter where we go?<br>
                Home<br>
                Home<br>
                Home<br>
                Home<br>
                So when I'm ready to be bolder<br>
                And my cuts have healed with time<br>
                Comfort will rest on my shoulder<br>
                And I'll bury my future behind<br>
                I'll always keep you with me<br>
                You'll be always on my mind<br>
                But there's a shining in the shadows<br>
                I'll never know unless I try<br>
                With every small disaster<br>
                I'll let the waters still<br>
                Take me away to some place real<br>
                'Cause they say home is where your heart is set in stone<br>
